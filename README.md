# A-Simple-Random-Forest-Model-to-Identify-Putative-Genes-Using-Conserved-Cysteine-Residues
This mini-project was aimed at evaluating the efficacy of Machine Learning (ML), specifically, Random Forest, in identifying putative gene regions, mainly characterised by 8 conserved CRs, within a genomic region undergoing strong Balancing Selection(BS)
