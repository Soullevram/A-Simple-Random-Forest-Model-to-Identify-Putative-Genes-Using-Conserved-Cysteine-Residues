    "# INTRODUCTION\n",
    "\n",
    "<div align=\"justify\">Elucidating how functional variants occur and persist in populations is an interesting topic in evolutionary biology. These variants are important for the persistence of polymorphism. How said variants exist and are maintained depends on the affecting selection pressures. Balancing selection (BS) is requisite for the perseverance of the genetic diversity of phenotypes in populations via overdominant and frequency-dependent selection [1,2]. Most importantly, the co-occurrence of varying adaptive variants of a trait is linked to BS [1]. BS is characterised by its transient background signatures in genomes, forming the base of the analytical framework used to identify BS [3]. Genomic regions undergoing strong balancing selection, especially those involving short, hypervariable protein-coding genes, are difficult to identify and or annotate because the signature is subtle and short-lived.</div>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<div align=\"justify\">Although genomic regions undergoing BS have hypervariable gene sequences, there are yet conserved residues within these regions. These residues are usually under positive selection, allowing for the existence of different alleles [4]. One of such residues is cysteine. Cysteine residues (CR) are vital for protein function via disulfide bridge formation and protein-to-protein intermolecular interactions [5]. Cysteine’s abundance or the effect of its mutation is tied to its function; so, even if Cysteine is not as abundant as other amino acids, the slightest mutation could have undesirable phenotypic effects, provided the CRs are functionally active [6]. BS helps maintain cysteine conservation in plant populations by stopping the proliferation of deleterious mutations that would interrupt cysteine functions.</div>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<div align=\"justify\">The genomic region analysed in this study contains a short, exonic gene, with less than 150 amino acids, characterised by 8 CRs, which may be emblematic of the gene of interest. Traditional annotation tools for identifying putative genes using conserved residues in regions undergoing BS are riddled with false positives and low detection power [7]. This limitation is due to the BS signatures being microscopic and momentary. Hence, other selection pressures can overshadow BS signatures or cause them to be mistaken for each other. However, machine learning (ML) can detect putative genes in regions undergoing positive selection or low-signature BS [7]. <div>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<div align=\"justify\">DNA/Protein sequences undergoing BS have numerous features with nonlinear interactions, making it complex for simple regression frameworks. A ML model of notable interest in putative gene prediction is Random Forest (RF) – a tree-based ensemble statistical method – which is well-suited to handle the problematic nature of genomic features’ high dimensionality [8]. Furthermore, RF is useful for supervised pattern matching in sequence data because: One, it is natively built to generate a trained decision tree that performs binary classification, which, in this case, is <i>does this sequence contain CRs or not?</i> Two, RF has a high predictive ability over other ML classification models, such as support vector machines, K-nearest-neighbours, and neural networks [9]. Consequently, these features make RF a choice tool for recognising patterns in genomic regions under strong BS. <div>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<div align=\"justify\">This study was aimed at evaluating the efficacy of ML, specifically, Random Forest, in identifying putative gene regions, mainly characterised by 8 conserved CRs, within a genomic region undergoing strong BS.</div>"

    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Functions\n",
    "#### Sequence Padding\n",
    "<div align=\"justify\">A helper function called <code>pad_seq</code> was created to ensure that the nucleotide sequences were multiples of 3 before translation, generating uniformly structured sequences with standardised lengths. This will avoid errors when using the translate option from Biopython. Additionally, this method achieves translation without trimming; thus, preventing the loss of biologically meaningful data.<div>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Open Reading Frame Extraction\n",
    "<div align=\"justify\">The <code>extract_orfs</code> function was used to identify open reading frames (ORFs) or exons, which are continuous regions with start and stop codons. The function searches all 6 ORFs: 3 forward and reverse, each. The <code>min_len</code> was set to 30 ORFs because very short amino acids (AA) or sequences do not often translate into functional proteins. The <code>max_len</code> was capped at 450 due to excessively long ORFs possibly extending into non-coding regions, leading to pseudo-AA sequences. Consequently, <code>max_len-min_len</code> range provides a balance between specificity and sensitivity, enabling the detection of biologically meaningful peptides without an increase in irrelevance.<div>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "       \n",
    "#### Extracting Sequence Features and Labelling Criterion\n",
    "<div align=\"justify\">The <code>extract_features</code> function was essential for the conversion of AA/peptide sequences into numerical data for ML classification. The sequences are strings and cannot be accepted by the ML model. The relaxed labelling criterion, 7 to 9 cysteine count (CC), was chosen to exclude short peptides with low CC and excessively long CC. Furthermore, many cysteine-rich peptides (CRPs) have 4-12 CC [10], and the (genomic) region of interest is characterised by 8 CC. Hence, the 7 to 9 CC is a fair delineation for the identification of functionally relevant number of cysteines. Peptides with 7-9 CC are labelled as positive (1) and, those without, negative (0). <code>Length</code>, <code>cysteine_count</code>, and <code>label</code> are the extracted features and form the training dataset.<div>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "        \n",
    "#### Create ML Input Data from FASTA Files\n",
    "<div align=\"justify\">The <code>create_dataset_from_folder</code> function pre-processes the input data by converting raw sequences (FASTA files) into data suitable for ML classification. The function creates a pre-processing pipeline that: One, performs batch processing of multiple input files; Two, uses <code>SeqIO.parse()</code> to iterate through FASTA files, <code>extract_orfs()</code> function to perform candidate peptide prioritisation (ORFs identification) on DNA sequences, and <code>extract_features()</code> to convert peptide sequences into ML-readable numerical input. The output is a pandas dataframe, consisting of binary label, sequence length, CC, and peptide sequence – with each row representing an ORF. <div>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### ML Model Training\n",
    "<div align=\"justify\">The <code>train_classifier</code> function was written to differentiate between CRPs and cysteine-poor peptides (CPPs). This function uses the length and CC features to train the ML model. Stratified splitting between training and testing datasets is initially attempted to ensure class distribution. However, if there are fewer subclasses than expected, to prevent a runtime error, random splitting is employed. The <code>RandomForestClassifier</code> was used because it works well with high-dimensional data. <code>test_size=0.3</code> was used because it is the commonly used data splitting ratio [11]; the training set is 0.7. <code>random_state=42</code> was set as the fixed seed to ensure reproducibility. <code>n_estimators</code> was set to 100, giving it a good baseline for training time and performance. <code>class_weight=balanced</code> was specified to handle class imbalance and reduce bias.<div>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Predictions from ML Model \n",
    "<div align=\"justify\">The <code>predict_on_file</code> function used a trained ML model to identify CRPs. <code>.predict_proba()</code> assigns a confidence score for each ORF. Only high-confidence predictions (probability > 0.9) are returned, ensuring only highly likely gene candidates are selected.<div>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "### BLAST Validation\n",
    "<div align=\"justify\">Using the high-scoring predictions, a BLAST validation was performed to determine if the predicted peptides matched experimentally-validated CRPs. Additionally, BLAST hits usually have annotations, which could help prescribe plausible biological functions of the ML predictions or identify homologs in other species.<div> \n"

    "<div align=\"justify\">Using the FASTA files, the ML model found 4071 ORFs (Table 1). 4060 of the ORFs were cysteine-poor, while 11 had a CC between 7 to 9, making them CRPs per the model specification. Only 9 of the 11 predicted ORFs had prediction scores > 0.9. The 2 low-confidence predictions were Cgr-B-H4-6I24 and Cgr-B-H5-14J22. Cgr-B-H7-9M04 had two high-confidence predictions, 0.99 and 0.91. The former had an AA length and CC of 65 and 8, respectively, while the latter, 228 and 7. The high AA length of the latter prediction casts doubts on it, as the CRP is reportedly within an exonic region of less than 150 AAs. Notably, the 0.99 prediction for Cgr-B-H7-9M04 had a CC of 8, the exact number of cysteine residues associated with the putative gene, existing across positions 11-12-21-36-46-50-57-64.<div>\n",

    "<div align=\"justify\">The prediction <i>Cgr-B-H6-3P02</i> was interesting because, even though it had a score of 0.92, the AA length (89), CC (9), and cysteine positions (24-40-50-58-72-74-83-85-88) made it promising. A high-scoring prediction by the Random Forest algorithm [9], although beneficial, is not the only deciding factor for the biological significance of the peptide prediction or the presence of the putative gene. The cysteine spacing (a prerequisite for disulfide bonding) and BLAST similarity report are equally important. For instance, <i>Cgr-B-H7-9M04</i>, albeit with a high-scoring prediction, had an adjacent cysteine pair (11-12), which would impede disulfide bond formation between the CRs [12]. Furthermore, BLAST analysis revealed a low-scoring percentage identity (Table 4) and an E-value to an uncharacterised protein.<div>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "<div align=\"justify\">However, <i>Cgr-B-H6-3P02</i>, with close clusters of CRs and a 0.92 prediction score, is somewhat spaced apart, allowing for a plausibly stable disulfide bond formation [12]. Additionally, BLAST (Table 4) revealed a 73.91% identity and 0.0 E-value similarity between <i>Cgr-B-H6-3P02</i> and Scarecrow Protein (SCRp), an actual S-locus CRP gene in <i>Arabidopsis spp.</i> [13]. Consequently, this predicted CRP is likely to be biologically functional, and the genomic region represented by <i>Cgr-B-H6-3P02</i> could contain the candidate gene.<div> \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div align=\"justify\">Surprisingly, no high-scoring similarities were found for <i>Cgr-B-H2-12I07</i>, <i>Cgr-B-H2-1H03</i>, <i>Cgr-B-H3-15B12</i>, <i>Cgr-B-H3-7N24</i>, <i>Cgr-B-H4-1G22</i>, and <i>Cgr-B-H5-19I12</i>, even though they all had at least 0.90 prediction scores (Table 3). This discrepancy can be elucidated by the classification report (Table 2). For the cysteine-poor peptides (0), the ML predicted 1219 in the testing set, all with 1.00 Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, suggesting a perfect prediction. However, for CRPs (1), only 3 predictions in the test data were perfect. This small number indicates that the CRPs are underrepresented, and, although the model performed well on this test data, it may not do so with other datasets. This underrepresentation bias can be corrected by augmenting the datasets with simulated CRPs or additional data [14]. Moreover, the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling (SMOTE) can be used to correct the class imbalance.<div>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div align=\"justify\">Alternatively, a motif-based search of ORFs using regular expressions can be used to identify CRPs linked to regions undergoing balancing selection. Similarly, structural prediction and disulfide bond formation using AlphaFold [15] and DISULFIND [16] are non-ML approaches that can identify CRPs associated with genes under strong balancing selection.<div>"
